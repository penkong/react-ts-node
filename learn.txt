all new load item is iframe.



what is iframe 
it take src that refer to html file of those info or app

we run js on frame of child iframe


javascript world of iframe is different .

in iframe you can access info from parent by typeing parent , windoe === parent
from parent reach to child , document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow

we must close direct access to each other .

for direct access :
when access happen when we dont provide sandbox prop or set it to 
sandbox=allow-same-origin


for disable :
sandbox="" // means what we allow the iframe do
or
also if domain , port and protocol become different direct access will remove.


now how add our js inputv inside it .


srcDoc={html} + sandbox="allow-scripts"
add this to iframe as prop
